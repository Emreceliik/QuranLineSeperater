**QuranLineSeperater** is a simple tool designed to separate each line of a Quran page into individual image files. This can be especially useful for projects involving Quranic OCR (Optical Character Recognition), educational applications, or mobile apps where displaying individual ayahs or lines separately is required. The tool processes an image of a Quran page and splits it line by line, maintaining high accuracy and quality.
